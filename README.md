     predict income ranges. This method harnesses data patterns for more accurate estimates compared to traditional methods. By fine-tuning the model and ensuring 
     interpretability, I could deliver precise insights to the client, highlighting the effectiveness of machine learning in tackling intricate tasks like income estimation.

ANS = I would approach this task by manually visiting the company pages on LinkedIn. Starting with the provided list, I would use the LinkedIn search feature to look up 
      each company name individually. Once I locate the company page, I would copy the URL from the browser's address bar. This way, I can ensure that I'm providing 
      accurate and up-to-date LinkedIn links for each company. Additionally, I would organize this information in a spreadsheet, including the company names and their 
      corresponding LinkedIn URLs for easy reference. If there are any variations in company names or potential duplicates, I would be sure to handle them attentively to 
      ensure accuracy.

Q4. 4. How to identify list of companies whose tech stack is built on Python. Give names of 5 companies if possible, by your suggested approach
ANS =  To find companies that use Python, I will start by looking at job listings on websites like Linkedin and Indeed. If a job requires Python skills it's a good sign the 
       company uses it. I'd also check out places where people share code, like GitHub. Companies that use Python often share their projects in github. I can also read 
       articles on company blogs and in tech magazines. Some well known companies that use Python are Instagram, Spotify and Reddit as of my knowledge.

Q5. Need to find an API, through which we can send linkedin messages to other linkedin users
ANS = Sending messages on LinkedIn through an API is not allowed by LinkedIn's rules. They don't provide a way for external programs to send messages to other users because 
      it could lead to privacy issues. Using unofficial or third-party methods to do this can get your account in trouble. It's better to use LinkedIn's own messaging 
      feature on their website or app. This way, you're following their rules and keeping things safe for everyone
